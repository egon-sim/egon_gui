GENERAL:
*+ all classes calling ErlInterface.Register should be subclassed from base class which handles registering and which unregisteres in destructor
*+ send/receive all state values as single TCP packet
*- destructors should unregister variables from erlInterface
*+ implement methods which start erlang release and stop it automatically
%0 wrap ErlInterface in a process separate from the rest of the API

BUGS:
*0 should classes in Simulator.cs receive reference to ErlInterface?
%0 ErlInterface.Call() has limitation in "data = new Byte[10000];"
*0 ErlInterface.Refresh, ErlInterface.Register and ErlInterface.Unregister should lock this.setters
